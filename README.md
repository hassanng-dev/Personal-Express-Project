# Personal-Express-Project


Have you ever gone grocery shopping and always forget something? Well look no further! Here I've created a shopping cart list where you can input all your neccessary items and have the ability to keep track and check off the items you've already put into your carts.



Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, Express, and MongoDB

How I built this project is using HTML and CSS for markup text and styling. I used Javascript for the logic of the project. For example I needed Javascript to have the ability to sort each item into its appropriate department such as, grocery, dairy, meats/seafood, produce, and household items. I also used Javascript to be able to delete items and make edits in case a mistake was made. In the back-end I used MongoDB to store any data I submitted to my database. Express was used to simplify the process of creating my database to store information. I was passionate about this project because I recongized that there were many times when I would go grocery shopping with just a mental list. After awhile I would forget an item or two and would have to make a second trip back.

LESSON LEARNED:

The lesson I learned is the process of using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to save information to my database. I learned more about Javascript and how powerful it is in the client and server side. I am excited to create more projects!
